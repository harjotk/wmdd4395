# Don't Panic!

one of the many aspects of the command line that can be confusing to newcomers is the terminology. command line, shell, terminal, bash, unix...?

here are a few basic commands to get you started.

`whoami`
`cd`
`ls`
`ls -a`
`mkdir`
`touch`
`rm`
`rm -rf`

`whereis` 
shows the location 

`pwd` 
present working directory this is probably visible in your prompt

`clear` 
clears the screen and moves the prompt to the top of a fresh blank terminal
